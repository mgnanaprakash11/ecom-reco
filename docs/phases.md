Here’s a phase-by-phase roadmap you can follow; each phase builds on the previous one, so tackle them sequentially.

  Phase 0 – Platform Foundations

  - Define tenant-aware Postgres schemas: core (shared enums), tenant_config, raw, staging, mart. Add tenant_id, batch_id, and source_system to every table
  you’ll touch later.
  - Configure Supabase Auth with invite-only sign-up, enrich user profiles with tenant metadata, and enforce RLS policies that scope all reads/writes by
  tenant_id.
  - Set up local/dev/prod environments (Vercel preview + Supabase projects). Create .env.template, pnpm scripts (pnpm env:pull), and secrets management
  docs.
  - Establish Trigger.dev project, queues, and retries; define naming conventions for tasks (e.g., ingest.csv.<source>).
  - Introduce observability primitives: structured logging (Pino), Trigger.dev run metadata table, and baseline dashboards in Logflare or Supabase logs.
  - Deliverables: ERD draft, RLS-tested seed data, running Next.js shell with protected routes, CI pipeline for lint/type-check, onboarding checklist.

  Phase 1 – Data Ingestion & Validation

  - Build CSV upload UI (multipart → Supabase Storage), storing metadata (tenant_id, file hash, schema version) in raw.uploads.
  - Implement Trigger.dev ingestion flow: validate headers, detect delimiter/encoding, enforce size limits, quarantine bad files, and emit status updates
  to raw.upload_runs.
  - Load rows into raw.<domain> tables as JSONB blobs alongside arrival timestamps and pointer to storage object. Use Drizzle for metadata tables; bulk
  inserts via pg COPY for row payloads.
  - Configure dbt project skeleton: profiles, model folders (models/raw, models/staging, models/marts), base seeds for reference data (platforms,
  commission types).
  - Automate dbt runs after each successful ingestion (Trigger.dev job or GitHub Action) and persist run outcomes.
  - Deliverables: repeatable ingestion for at least one platform (e.g., Amazon), automated validation errors surfaced to UI/Slack, dbt debug run completing
  end-to-end.

  Phase 2 – dbt Transformations & Data Contracts

  - Author staging models that normalize JSON → typed columns, add surrogate keys, and enforce unique/not-null tests.
  - Layer mart models for reporting (daily payouts, order fee breakdowns, anomaly flags). Use incremental models keyed by tenant_id, order_id, batch_id.
  - Publish explicit schema contracts via dbt docs; fail builds on breaking changes.
  - Create data-quality dashboards: ingestion counts vs. staging counts, unmatched rows, freshness SLA monitors.
  - Deliverables: automated dbt build pipeline, versioned staging/mart schema, dbt docs hosted (Vercel or Supabase), alerting for failed tests.

  Phase 3 – Reconciliation Engine

  - Model customer-defined rules: tables for recon_rule_sets, rule_conditions, tolerances, and outputs (JSON for dynamic logic). Provide admin UI to edit +
  version rules with effective dates.
  - Implement core reconciliation procedures in Postgres (CTEs/materialized views for matching payouts to orders, tax reconciliation, commission recalcs).
  Optimize with indexes/partitioning by tenant/month.
  - Orchestrate via Trigger.dev: job scheduler reading pending batches, invoking Postgres stored procedures, capturing metrics, and marking recon_runs with
  statuses (pending, running, matched, exceptions).
  - Handle exceptions: persist mismatches in recon_exceptions with foreign keys back to raw + staging rows; include diff payloads for UI.
  - Deliverables: deterministic reconciliation for first platform, automated reruns on rule updates, audit trail per run, initial KPI outputs (match rate,
  variance amount).

  Phase 4 – Workflow, Alerts, & External Integrations

  - Build notification pathways: Slack/webhooks/email for failed ingestions, recon exceptions breaching thresholds, or rule version changes.
  - Add approval workflow tables (e.g., finance teams marking an exception “accepted” or “requires vendor follow-up”). Trigger.dev tasks should update
  statuses and notify stakeholders.
  - Integrate optional external data sources (payment gateways, GST filings) via API fetchers to enrich reconciliation, caching responses in
  external_cache.
  - Implement SLA monitoring and run-time budgeting (Trigger.dev concurrency controls, Postgres resource groups, backpressure for large tenants).
  - Deliverables: end-to-end alerting tested, configurable SLA thresholds per tenant, exception lifecycle dashboards, documented runbook for operations.

  Phase 5 – Productized UI & Growth Readiness

  - Expand Next.js app: onboarding wizard capturing platform selections, commission matrices, SKU COGS. Store configs in tenant_config.* tables and version
  records for historical accuracy.
  - Build dashboards: overview cards (net revenue, payouts, fees, net profit), trend charts, recent exceptions. Use server components pulling from mart
  tables or cached APIs.
  - Orders & exceptions pages: table views with filters (date, platform, status), detail drawer showing itemized charges, reconciliation result, audit
  logs, comment threads.
  - Performance: add edge caching or suspense boundaries, paginate heavy tables, prefetch summaries via Next.js route handlers backed by Supabase RLS
  policies.
  - Prepare for onboarding new merchants: templated imports, docs, in-app guides, billing hooks (metered events recorded per reconciliation run).
  - Deliverables: production-ready UI, tenant self-service onboarding, performance budget met in Vercel analytics, customer-facing documentation and
  support playbooks.

  Follow this sequence to ensure each phase provides stable foundations for the next, minimizes rework, and keeps business stakeholders in the loop with
  incremental value.
